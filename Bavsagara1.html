        <h1>Who is Sealed Blaze Maiden, Bavsagara?</h1>
        <img src="images/Bavsagara/Bavsagara-Card.jpg">
        <p><em><h3>
            "A Sealed Flame Priest whose mission is to save people from the despair that covers the world. Displaying tremendous fighting power by "equipping" herself with weapons and shields, she is the leader of the Sealed Blaze Dragons. Although she is of the human race, she has four white wings growing out of her back. It is said that during the Godless Era, when many dragons fell into slumber, the Sealed Blaze Maiden, Bavsargra gave a dark flame to the dragons who were suffering from the loneliness of protecting their sleeping comrades and reincarnated them. <br><br>
            It was not only the dragons who were despairing in this age without divine blessings. Accompanied by the Sealed Flame Dragons, she has gathered the faith of those who despaired in the Godless Era and prayed "I want this kind of suffering to end", and has become a major force.
            Bavsargra's birth is shrouded in mystery, but it is said that before the dragons that closely guard her, she seems to shows a completely different side of her, the gentle and reserved girl, Rinolily."

            Exclusive to Bavsagara is her use of Arms. While the other set of Arms she has is locked behind higher rarities, Bavsagara is serviceable with just her Shield and Sword. Added cards to the deck are either stronger or more efficient versions of previous cards (Skishanya or Ihsita), or are utility units that allow you to recover resources (Gojo). Arm Bavsagara with the Sealed Blaze Weapons and carve a path to victory!

            Bavsagara with high rarity support is strong, with the Blaze Spear allowing Bavsagara to go full power immediately when she arrives. Support cards in this deck will either help in Arming Bavsagara, or are cards that work with Arms.
