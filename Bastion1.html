        <p><em><h3>
            "Captain of the Cloud Knights Heavenly Brigade, as well as the owner of the holy sword. Fully covered in shining armor himself, his mount is also similarly armored. Supposedly from the human race, but nobody knows his age. The face of the law-enforcing Cloud Knights, his judgement is just and strict, and his orders absolute. He commands both respect and awe from brigade members and the populace alike."

            Bastion is 1 of 2 of the Start Decks without a keyword as their specialty, but that doesnt stop it from being good. Most of the support from this deck are from D-BT01, so you may or may not have difficulty obtaining the cards due to the cards being released a year ago. However, the deck is pretty decent, with crit pressure and multi-attack thanks to Lepisto and Phanuel. Unite with your allies and corner your opponent with powerful but costly effects!

            Just like the previous decklists, this maxed out Bastion decklist makes use of his evolved form, whose effect is much stronger than the original. With the "Pride to Protect" order card, Grade 3s can support each other, which makes cards like Alden, and Cornvoc even stronger and better.
