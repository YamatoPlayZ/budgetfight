        <h1>Who is Jewel-embracing Dragon Fang, Drajeweled?</h1>
        <img src="images/Drajeweled/Drajeweled-Card.jpg">
        <p><em><h3>
            "The head of the Rainbow Demonic Dragons. Normally, it secludes itself in its own dungeon, the 'Rainbow Demonic Dragon Dungeon', protecting the Rainbow Magic Stones. "Rainbow Magic Stones" are made from the "miasma" that covers the dark region of the Dark States, and only the 'Rainbow Demonic Dragons' can crystallize it. In fact, it has the power to overpower the Demon Lords of the Dark States, but it basically has no interest in fighting, and when it is not crystallizing "Rainbow Magic Stones", it indulges in idle slumber within its lair. But if the magic stones that shine rainbow-colored were to ever be stolen, the world would come to know Drajeweled's terrible wrath."

            Drajeweled's ability is to reduce the power of the vanguard, but with a very heavy cost of 4 cards with different grades in soul. Support cards in this deck either work with large amounts of soul (Quen Lu), or are units that aid in obtaining soul (Selfish Engraver). Engulf your opponent in darkness and swallow them with the power of Drajeweled and his minions!

            Since D-BT07 has not been released in English, Drajeweled continues to make use of most of the Trial Deck given, adding a few cards such as Brainwash Swirler, making use of staple sentinels and trigger units, and a maxed out version of this deck will require a second trial deck. The deck plays out similarly to the budget deck, so it is advisable to wait for D-BT07 for more support.
