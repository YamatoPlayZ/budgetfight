            Magnolia is 1 of 2 of the Start Decks without a keyword as their specialty, but unlike Bastion, this units most powerful effect is locked behind "Persona Ride". Most of the support from this deck are cards that are either improved versions of cards in the start deck, (Brave Shooter, Ghost Chase, Abyss Temptation), or are cards that make it so that the deck does not feel as bad when the opponent pulls a trigger (Molemora and Marco). Make use of "Persona Ride" to lead a charge against the opposing side, unleashing waves of attacks.

            Just like the previous decklists, this maxed out Magnolia decklist makes use of his evolved form, whose effect is much stronger than the original. Magnolia Elder allows you to do what Grade 3 Magnolia does but better. As such, support cards are units that benefit from being in the back row, or cards that are good if 5 or more attacks were made.
