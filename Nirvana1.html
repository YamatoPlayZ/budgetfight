            Deck Code: <a href = https://decklog-en.bushiroad.com/view/9B9W>9B9W</a></h3></center>
            D-SD01 introduces the "overDress" mechanic exclusive to Nirvana, allowing the little "Trickstar" to get even stronger. Unfortunately, all of Vairina's other forms are locked behind higher rarities so building a cheap version of this deck is not possible. Commons included in this deck either benefit on having overDress cards (Prayer of Resonating Wishes or Hadou Shugen) or are cards that synergize with Nirvana (Holy Flames that Binds). Other cards are just units that help you out if you are out of options. Make use of "overDress" to control the battlefield.

        <p><h3>
            <h3>
                <li>Deck is fairly consistent, which means you get to your main pieces easily.</li>
                <li>The deck attacks with high powered columns.</li>
                <li>The deck has removal tools (Vairina and Hadou Shugen) in order to remove key units in the opposing side.</li>

        <p><h2><center>Cons</center></h2></p>
        <p><h3>
                <li>The deck is locked to 3 attacks at max, but is a problem to the rideline as a whole.</li>
                <li>The deck is very reliant on having Vairina or an overDressed card on the field in which you only have 4 copies of, and has a bad matchup on decks with removal.</li>
                <li>The deck's draw power and resource recovery is not high. Some of these problems, however are either solved or alleviated when the deck is fully upgraded.</li>

            While the budget deck is fairly simple to build, a maxed out version of Nirvana deck is probably hard or expensive to make (mainly due to being the main protagonist's deck). With a large variation of Vairina forms, the deck is more versatile and is much better in terms of power and resource management.
