        <h1>Who is Youthberk "Protofall Arms"?</h1>
        <img src="images/Youthberk/Youthberk-Card.jpg">
        <p><em><h3>
            "A mysterious knight who raises the word "Skyfall" as he fights against the corruption and evil that infests the Keter Sanctuary both in the heavens and on the ground. The Skyfall Knight Order is not an organization recognized by the nation or the government, regarding the wealthy, who turn their backs on the poverty of the ground and line their own pockets, and the Cloud Knights as their enemy, but most of the dissatisfied people on the ground are their potential collaborators. It is said that wherever Youthberk appears, the cheers and support of the ground's people, and an even stronger force of resistance will arise."

            Youthberk's gimmick is RevolDress, a mechanic that changes your vanguard into different forms. The trial deck gives you one form, RevolForm: Zest, which allows you to attack with high power and crit presure. With the power of RevolDress, become a great force of power that demolishes the battlefield!

            With D-BT06, Youthberk gains access to not only a new RevolForm, but it also gains access to a slightly better version of himself. Just like Lianorn and Drajeweled, a maxed out version of the deck will require a second trial deck, due to the need for Cadwalla.
