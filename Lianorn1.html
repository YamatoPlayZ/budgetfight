        <h1>Who is Bandmaster of Blossoming Bonds, Lianorn?</h1>
        <img src="images/Lianorn/Lianorn-Card.jpg">
        <p><em><h3>
            "The "World Tree Marching Band" travels the world, revitalising Planet Cray with the music they dedicate to the World Trees. Lianorn is the bioroid girl who serves as the leader of this marching band. Holding her "Conducting Baton, Drum Major Baton" high, she leads musicians of various musical instruments and the colour guards dressed in full bloom flowers. She has an extremely delicate sensitivity, with it rumoured that she is able to "communicate with the World Trees at will". Her brilliance brings a smile to the faces of all who watch, but when it comes to the band, she shows a perfectionist side of herself. She and Bavsargra are close enough to exchange letters between each other."

            Deck Code: <a href = https://decklog-en.bushiroad.com/view/GAF0>GAF0</a></h3></center>
            Lianorn ability allows her to become boosted by the entire back row, increasing her power by a lot, and in addition, she also gains triple drive too, which makes her really powerful. However her supporting attackers in the front row are not as good, which is why "Creed Assault" is added. Other support cards in the deck either work when boosted (Recorder Racoon) or increase the power of units or calling cards to the field (Happy Dreaming Festa! and Marco). Unite the back row and make use of Lianorn skill to create a resounding victory.
