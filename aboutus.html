        My relationship with Cardfight!! Vanguard started around 2015, when my neighbor and longtime friend introduced me to the game, which we soon fell in love with. Back then, we were not really aware of the concept of upgrading our decks and limited ourselves to Trial Decks as we thought they gave the most bang for our buck, as we did not have access to a lot of money. We soon realized that there were things we could do to upgrade our decks, so we started looking up cheap options, which we soon kept doing. With the accessibility of the game right now, with cheap starter decks and a lot of options of buying cards, Vanguard could never be more accessible than now.

        This is why this website was made, in order to show potential new players how to play the game on a budget; limiting ourselves to trial decks and then upgrading decks with cards of the common rarity in booster sets, which shows them a basic version of the deck to see if they like it, and then showing a prospective upgraded deck for payers who like the archetype.

        This website was made to guide new players to the game, giving them budget options for decks, giving them an easy and cheap way to play the game and spice up the trial and start decks ready available. Once players have tried the game, the website also presents a lot of potential upgrades to the deck to players who wish to upgrade their decks further.
